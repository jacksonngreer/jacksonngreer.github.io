                                        <p>"The Ethics of AI"</p>

                                        <p>In a time where many are worried about their jobs being replaced by technology, it may be comforting to hear that even centuries ago people shared the same fears. Textile and agricultural workers were the first to see their jobs transformed. When Ford introduced the assembly line, it became more common for workers to do a specialized, repetitive task, rather than the whole process, like a craftsman shoemaker being replaced by a group who can mass produce with the assistance of machines. Throughout technological advancement, people have always been replaced, but they have always found adjacent things to do. It would be even more comforting for me to say that modern advancement is no different and we will all settle into new jobs. Unfortunately, I cannot say that is the case.</p>
                                        <p>The technology of the past transformed jobs by making labor more efficient and, most importantly, increasing profits through higher output. However, unlike previous technological advancements that primarily enhanced human labor, the technology of today—especially artificial intelligence—has the potential to replace jobs altogether. While innovations in fields like medicine, science, and research may improve lives, the negative consequences for the average person’s day-to-day life could be more far-reaching.</p>
                                            <p>From a business perspective, replacing humans with artificial intelligence offers clear advantages—machines don’t require time off, personal events, or salary raises. In purely financial terms, automation makes sense. Our understanding of ethics and morals is what makes the idea unsettling.</p>
                                            <p>If AI continues on its current trajectory, few professions are safe. A worst-case scenario could look like the middle class shrinking as jobs are polarized, with employment being concentrated at the top and bottom of the economic ladder. To avoid this scenario, ethics need to be a primary consideration when implementing new technology. So, what would that look like?</p>
                                            <p>Companies must prioritize transparency in their plans with AI so that employees can make informed career decisions. They should also take responsibility for the impact of AI by offering reskilling programs to help employees transition into new roles and work alongside technology, rather than being replaced by it. However, ethics is often a gray area in law. Just because you should do something doesn’t mean it’s legally required. Unless required by law, large companies historically rarely prioritize ethics over profits, as their main function is to maximize shareholder wealth.</p>
                                            <p>In the same way governments prevent monopolies or regulate industries like finance or healthcare to protect the public, they can implement policies to oversee AI development and usage. Requiring companies to disclose how they integrate AI, conduct regular impact assessments, and adhere to ethical standards can ensure accountability. Independent regulatory bodies could audit AI systems to verify compliance with these rules and prevent misuse. Such measures would not only create transparency but also discourage unethical behavior, while still allowing innovation to thrive. This balance between regulation and freedom is key to fostering progress without risking the harm of unregulated technology.</p>
